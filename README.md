# YouTube_Video_Summarizer
This is the design and implementation of a summarizer for video content. 
My project, “YouTube Video Summarizer,” as the name suggests, is software for providing the text summary of a YouTube video.
YouTube users tend to face difficulty in deciphering the appropriate video for them. 
This particular project deals with the problems pertaining to the text summaries that are much needed for various reasons and applications.
Identification of the drawbacks of the existing system leads to the idea of designing our project, that will be helpful as well as user-friendly.
